# HR Analytics Dashboard Report

## 1. Introduction
This report presents the HR Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI, aimed at providing comprehensive insights into employee attrition. The dashboard showcases key metrics such as the total number of employees (1416), the number of employees who have left (229), the attrition rate (16.2%), average age (37 years), average salary ($6.5K), and average tenure (7.0 years). 

## 2. Problem Statement
The organization is experiencing high employee attrition rates, impacting productivity, morale, and overall business performance. There is a need to understand the underlying causes of attrition through data analysis to develop effective retention strategies.

## 3. Objective
To analyze employee attrition patterns and identify key factors influencing turnover, and subsequently develop data-driven strategies to improve employee retention and reduce attrition rates.

## 4. Development Process
The development process began with the collection of data from HR systems, encompassing employee demographics, job roles, salary information, and attrition records. This data was meticulously cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy. Following this, a robust data model was created in Power BI that connected various data sources for seamless analysis. 

## 5. Data Preprocessing
I meticulously prepared the data for analysis. This involved cleaning up the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring data uniformity. I transformed data types as needed to facilitate analysis and visualization. By diligently addressing these data quality issues, I created a solid foundation for building informative dashboards and extracting meaningful insights in Power BI.
